1. Searching with grep (find the word 'cron')
  ls -l /etc | grep cron

2. Sorting (sort items by size (column 5))
  ls -l /etc | sort -k 5n

3. Showing Top/Bottom with tail
  ls -l /etc | sort -k 5n | tail
  { -k 5n: sort by the 5th column(file size), numerically}
  { tail: Shows the last 10 items after sorting. }

4. Counting with wc -l
  ls -l /etc | wc-l
  { wc -l: counts the number of lines}

5. Running Multiple commands using (;)
  ls -l /etc | sort -k 5n | tail; ls /etc |wc -l
  {; Runs two commands separately, 
    first: show 10 largest file from the bottom
    second: count total files}

6. Checking Success with $?
  echo $? 
  {0 = success, Non-zero = failure}
