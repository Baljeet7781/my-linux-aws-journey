# systemctl stop firewalld.service
# systemctl status firewalld.service

Note: If you have lowered your server's firewall to conduct these nmap scans, be sure to raise it again. Enter systemctl start firewalld.service.

Understanding nmap port states
1. open: 
  > A service is actively listening on this port.
  > It's like a shop with its door open and a sign saying "Welcome!"
  > Risky if the service is not secured, attackers can interact with it.

2. closed:
  > The port is reachable, but no service listening.
  > It's like a door that exists but is locked - you know someone lives there. 
  > Confirms the system is alive at that IP.

3. filtered:
  > A firewall is blocking access to the port.
  > nmap can't tell if the port is open or closed.
  > It's like a hidden door behind a wall, you can't even see if its there.

4. unfiltered
  > nmap can reach the port, but can't determine if it's open or closed.
  > It's like seeing a door but not knowing if its locked or open.

5. open|filtered
  > nmap can't tell if the port is open or filtered
  > could be open but but hidden by a firewall

6. closed|filtered
  > nmap can't tell if the port is closed or filtered.
  > could be locked or hidden - not enough info.
